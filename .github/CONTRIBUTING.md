# How to contribute to Kattis

Hey there! :wave: I'm happy to see you're interested in contributing to the project. I'm always down to learn and improve, so I'd love to see what I could look into.

#### **Encountered an Issue? :bug:**

* Before submitting a new issue, please take a moment to check the existing issues to avoid duplicates. If your issue is unique, proceed to [open a new one](YourNewIssueLink). A descriptive title and a detailed account of the issue, along with any relevant code or tests, will greatly assist in resolving it promptly.

#### **Have a Better Solution? :hammer_and_wrench:**

* Great to hear! Feel free to fork the repository, create a branch for your updates, and submit a pull request.

* In your pull request, please provide a clear description of the issue and your solution. If your update addresses an existing issue, mention that issue number.

#### **Code Clean-up? :broom:**

* If you're making formatting changes or minor tweaks that don't affect functionality, consider whether these contribute to the overall quality of the project. While I appreciate attention to detail, such changes may not always be incorporated.

#### **Proposing a New Feature? :bulb:**

* If you have an idea for enhancing the project or want to suggest a change, let's discuss it. Start by opening a discussion or sending a direct message to ensure we align on the idea before you begin work.

#### **Questions About the Code? :mag:**

* If there are parts of the codebase that are unclear or you'd like more information on how things work, don't hesitate to reach out. Open a discussion or send a message, and I'll provide clarity or further documentation.

#### **Interested in Improving Documentation? :books:**

* Quality documentation is vital to the project. Contributions to enhance or clarify the documentation are highly encouraged and valued.

This project serves as a platform for learning and exploration. While maintaining a professional and constructive environment, we also embrace the spirit of collaboration and open exchange. Your contributions are greatly appreciated.

Looking forward to your contributions! ðŸ”¥
